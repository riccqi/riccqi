### Hey I'm Richard ðŸ‘‹


I'm a Computer Science undergraduate studying at the National University of Singapore. I've been dabbling with web and iOS development, and still exploring other things I like to do.
I enjoy watching good animated movies and looping their soundtracks when I do work.

Reach out to me to collab on fun projects or if you want a movie recommendation ðŸ˜Š
